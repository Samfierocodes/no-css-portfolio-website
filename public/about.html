<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sam Fiero and I've been a web designer since 2020 but I've never had the courage to learn the coding part of web design and web developmnt. I've always been the wordpress and template guy</p>

<p>I finally gather up the courage and went for it. here am I now writing codes</p>

<p>I'm so proud of myself.</p>
